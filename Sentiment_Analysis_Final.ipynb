    "- **Average word length** - We will also extract another feature which will calculate the average word length of each review. This can also potentially help us in improving our model. Here, we simply take the sum of the length of all the words and divide it by the total length of the review:\n",
    "- **Number of stopwords** - Generally, while solving an NLP problem, the first thing we do is to remove the stopwords. But sometimes calculating the number of stopwords can also give us some extra information which we might have been losing before.\n",
    "- **Number of special characters** - One more interesting feature which we can extract from a review is calculating the number of special characters present in it. This also helps in extracting extra information from our text data.\n",
    "- **Number of numerics** - Just like words, we calculate the number of numerals present in each review\n",

    "- **Stemming** - Stemming is the process of producing morphological variants of a root/base word. Stemming programs are commonly referred to as stemming algorithms or stemmers. A stemming algorithm reduces the words “chocolates”, “chocolatey”, “choco” to the root word, “chocolate” and “retrieval”, “retrieved”, “retrieves” reduce to the stem “retrieve”. There are mainly two errors in stemming – overstemming and under stemming. Over-stemming occurs when two words are stemmed to same root that are of different stems. Under-stemming occurs when two words are stemmed to same root that are not of different stems.\n",
    "- **Ngrams** -  N-grams of texts are basically a set of co-occuring words within a given window and when computing the n-grams you typically move one word forward (although you can move X words forward in more advanced scenarios). N-grams are used to develop not just unigram models but also bigram and trigram models. Optimum length really depends on the application – if your n-grams are too short, you may fail to capture important differences. On the other hand, if they are too long, you may fail to capture the “general knowledge” and only stick to particular cases.\n",
    "- **Tokenization** - Tokenization is the process of breaking up the given text into units called tokens. The tokens may be words or number or punctuation mark. Tokenization does this task by locating word boundaries. Ending point of a word and beginning of the next word is called word boundaries. Tokenization is also known as word segmentation. \n",
    "- **Lemmatization** - Lemmatization usually refers to doing things properly with the use of a vocabulary and morphological analysis of words, normally aiming to remove inflectional endings only and to return the base or dictionary form of a word, which is known as the lemma.\n",
    "- **Term Frequency (TF)** - is a scoring of the frequency of the word in the current document. Since every document is different in length, it is possible that a term would appear much more times in long documents than shorter ones. The term frequency is often divided by the document length to normalize. Therefore, we can generalize term frequency as:\n",
    "TF = (Number of times term T appears in the particular row) / (number of terms in that row)\n",
    "- **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)** - IDF is a scoring of how rare the word is across documents. IDF is a measure of how rare a term is. Rarer the term, more is the IDF score."

A subjective sentence may not express any sentiment. For example, “I think that he went home” and “I want a camera that can take good photos” are a subjective sentences, but does not express any sentiment."
